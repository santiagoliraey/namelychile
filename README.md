# Welcome to Your New App!

Get started in 3 easy steps:

1. In your **Terminal pane**, enter: `bundle`
2. Click the green **Run** button (or use the menu `Run > Run With > Ruby on Rails (stable + Ruby 2.2)`)
3. There is no step 3.

If you're in class and fall behind, you can run this command to catch up:

`./catchup`
# payrollchile
# payrollchile
# snip
